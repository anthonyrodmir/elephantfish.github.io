abstract = {Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful 
new family of deep generative models with record-breaking 
performance in many applications, including image synthesis, 
video generation, and molecule design. In this survey, we 
provide an overview of the rapidly expanding body of work 
on diffusion models, categorizing the research into three key
areas: efficient sampling, improved likelihood estimation, 
and handling data with special structures. We also discuss 
the potential for combining diffusion models with other 
generative models for enhanced results. We further review 
the wide-ranging applications of diffusion models in fields 
spanning from computer vision, natural language processing, 
temporal data modeling, to interdisciplinary applications in 
other scientific disciplines. This survey aims to provide a 
contextualized, in-depth look at the state of diffusion models, 
identifying the key areas of focus and pointing to potential areas
for further exploration. Github:},
