abstract = {When a body oscillates laterally (cross-flow) in a free stream, it can synchronize the vortex formation frequency with the body motion frequency. This fundamental “lock-in” regions is but one in a whole series of synchronization regions, which have been found in the present paper, in an amplitude-wavelength plane (defining the body trajectory) up to amplitudes of five diameters. In the fundamental region, it is shown that the acceleration of the cylinder each half cycle induces the roll-up of the two shear layers close to the body, and thereby the formation of four regions of vorticity each cycle. Below a critical wavelength, each half cycle sees the coalescence of a pair of like-sign vortices and the development of a Karman-type wake. However, beyond this wavelength the like-sign vortices convect away from each other, and each of them pairs with an opposite-sign vortex. The resulting wake comprises a system of vortex pairs which can convect away from the wake centerline. The process of pairing causes the transition between these modes to be sudden, and this explains the sharp change in the character of the cylinder forces observed by Bishop and Hassan, and also the jump in the phase of the lift force relative to body displacement. At precisely the critical wavelength, only two regions of vorticity are formed, and the resulting shed vorticity is more concentrated than at other wavelengths. We interpret this particular case as a condition of “resonant synchronization”, and it corresponds with the peak in the body forces observed in Bishop and Hassan's work.}

abstract = {The spectra from cross-flow VIV signals contain peaks at the dominant vortex shedding frequency but also at several other frequencies, notably at three times and five times that frequency. These higher harmonic contributions are important because they are associated with high fatigue damage rates. The understanding of what controls higher harmonic response is far from complete. This paper presents a trend-constrained, data-driven model to discover important features (parameters) affecting the higher harmonic response of flexible cylinders subjected to vortex-induced vibrations. The predicted dependent parameter is the ratio of stress at the 3rd harmonic divided by the stress at the dominant VIV frequency. The known effects of damping and bending stiffness are introduced as physical constraints to improve the DNN predictions and aid in important parameter identification. The machine learning predictions with and without prior physical constraints are compared. The comparison suggests that the machine learning model with prior physical constraints better handles independent experimental datasets. It is confirmed that the higher stress ratios are associated with smaller damping parameter values and smaller bending stiffness ratios. The larger stress ratio is also found to be associated with traveling waves and single-mode-dominated responses.}
