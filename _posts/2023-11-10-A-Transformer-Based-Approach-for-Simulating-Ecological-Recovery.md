## Introduction
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures a wide spectrum of light per pixel, providing detailed information across numerous contiguous spectral bands. Unlike multispectral imaging, which only captures a few specific bands, hyperspectral imaging offers finer spectral resolution, allowing for more precise identification and analysis of materials. This capability makes it valuable in remote sensing for applications like mineral exploration, agriculture (e.g., crop health monitoring), environmental studies, and land cover classification. Each spectral band captures unique light wavelengths, enabling the identification of specific spectral signatures associated with different materials or conditions on the Earth's surface. HSI images present unique challenges in deep learning compared to typical RGB images due to their high dimensionality. Each pixel in a hyperspectral image contains information across hundreds of spectral bands, leading to a massive increase in the data's complexity and volume. This makes model training more computationally intensive and can lead to issues like overfitting if not handled properly. Current datasets, such as the Indian Pines or Salinas Scenes datasets, often have fewer samples compared to standard image datasets, exacerbating the difficulty in training deep learning models without overfitting. There's also the challenge of effectively extracting and utilizing the rich spectral information in these images, which requires specialized architectures and processing techniques. However, analysis of hyperspectral data is of great importance in many practical applications, such as land cover/use classification or change and object detection and there is momentum in the field of remote sensing to embrace deep learning. 

Traditional hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) methods, based on pattern recognition and manually designed features, struggled with spectral variability. Deep learning, particularly CNNs, brought advancements by extracting intricate spectral-spatial features, enhancing HSIC's accuracy. Yet, CNNs have their drawbacks, such as a propensity for overfitting due to the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data and limitations imposed by their fixed-size kernel, which could obscure the classification boundary and fail to capture varying spatial relationships in the data effectively.

Compared to CNNs, there is relatively little work on using vision transformers for HSI classification but they have great potential as they have been excelling at many different tasks and  have great potential in the field of HSI classification. Vision transformers, inspired by the Transformer architecture initially designed for natural language processing, have gained attention for their capacity to capture intricate patterns and relationships in data. This architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms, allowing it to model long-range dependencies effectively, which can be particularly advantageous in hyperspectral data where spatial-spectral interactions are crucial. Spectral signatures play a pivotal role in HSI analysis, enabling the differentiation of materials or conditions based on their distinct spectral characteristics, a capability that conventional RGB images cannot provide. Leveraging the strengths of vision transformers to effectively capture and exploit these spectral signatures holds promise for advancing the accuracy and precision of HSI in remote sensing classification tasks. 


### Spectral Feature-Based Methods and Spatial–Spectral Feature-Based Methods

Spectral feature-based approaches classify hyperspectral images (HSIs) by analyzing each spectral pixel vector individually. However, this method has limitations as it overlooks the spatial context of the pixels. Spatial–spectral feature-based methods on the other hand, consider both the spectral and spatial characteristics of HSIs in a more integrated manner. These methods involve using a patch that includes the target pixel and its neighboring pixels, instead of just the individual pixel, to extract spatial–spectral features. Among these methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly prominent, having shown significant effectiveness in HSI classification. Despite the success of CNN-based models in classifying HSIs, they are not without issues. The CNN's receptive field is limited by the small size of its convolutional kernels, such as 3×3 or 5×5, which makes it challenging to model the long-range dependencies and global information in HSIs. Additionally, the complexity of convolution operations makes it difficult to emphasize the varying importance of different spectral features.

When comparing spectral feature-based methods with spatial–spectral feature-based methods in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, each has distinct advantages and applications. Spectral feature-based methods are valued for their simplicity and efficiency, especially effective in scenarios where unique spectral signatures are key, such as in material identification or pollution monitoring. They require less computational power, making them suitable for resource-limited applications. Alternatively, spatial–spectral feature-based methods offer a more comprehensive approach by integrating both spectral and spatial information, leading to higher accuracy in complex scenes. This makes them ideal for detailed land cover classification, urban planning, and military surveillance where spatial context is crucial. Among spatial–spectral methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stand out for their advanced feature extraction capabilities and adaptability, making them useful in a variety of applications, from automatic target recognition to medical imaging. Although, they face challenges such as the need for large datasets and difficulties in capturing long-range spatial dependencies. While spectral methods are efficient and effective in specific contexts, spatial–spectral methods, particularly those using CNNs, offer greater versatility and accuracy at the cost of increased computational complexity.

### Hyperspectral Image Classification 

<u>Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN3D)</u>

The first stage will involve the collection of multi-spectral satellite imagery and high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of MTR-affected landscapes. This data will be preprocessed to ensure compatibility, which includes image normalization, augmentation, and the alignment of satellite imagery with corresponding DEMs to maintain spatial congruence. Preprocessing will also involve the segmentation of satellite data into labeled datasets for supervised learning, with categories representing different land cover types relevant to ecological states.

<u>SpectralFormer</u>

Transformer models have exhibited remarkable success beyond their initial domain of natural language processing. Their unique self-attention mechanism enables them to capture long-range dependencies, making them a potentially good choice for complex spatial analysis. Vision Transformers, in particular, offer a new approach by treating image patches as tokens and allowing them to process the global context of an image effectively. This capability is beneficial for satellite imagery analysis, where understanding the broader environmental context is critical. Transformers designed for point cloud data, adapting to the inherent irregularities of LiDAR measurements, can potentially uncover intricate structural patterns and temporal changes within landscape data. With strategic approaches like transfer learning, transformers can overcome their computational resource complexity. 

<u>Group-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (GAHT)</u>

The final step will be the development of a 3D simulation environment using Unreal Engine. The simulation will visualize the predicted ecological states and changes over time, providing an interactive tool for users to explore the landscape recovery process. The interface will allow users to manipulate variables and observe potential outcomes of different restoration strategies in a virtual setting.

### Conclusions

For the spatial analysis of satellite imagery and LiDAR data, the evaluation will focus on the transformer’s ability to discern and classify diverse land cover types. The key metrics for this assessment will include accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score extracted from confusion matrices. The model should accurately identify and categorize ecological features from high-resolution imagery. 
Temporally, the performance will be evaluated based on its capacity to predict ecological changes over time. This involves analyzing the model’s output against a time series of known data points to calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for continuous predictions or log-loss for discrete outcomes.
